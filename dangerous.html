        Why you shouln't fight Milozs
    </p>
    <p class="whytext">
        Milozs is a very good police player in EH, he can kill you and arrest you in every moment, he can
        be good and let you free (if you are his friend), but you can be killed be him and... if  someone do 
        something to me, Milozs go defend me!
